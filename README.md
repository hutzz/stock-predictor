# STOCK PREDICTOR

Predicts stock prices using long short-term memory (LSTM).

Note: This is is a fairly basic model, **and is not in any way, shape, or form expected to be accurate as far as predicting movements in the stock market.** In Burton Malkiel's _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_, Malkiel states that stock prices cannot be predicted from price history, and this model uses price history exclusively.

Rather, this project was merely a way for me to gain practice with LSTM, time series data, and neural networks in general.
